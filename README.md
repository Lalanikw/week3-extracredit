Eye for the elephant

Introduction to Elephant Eye game
Here is how we play the game. This game can be played in teams or individually. However, it can be more fun when you play individually. What you need is a chair, big white board, marker pen and a good black opaque cloth about a 1/2 yard. We need to draw side view of an elephant on the white board. Make sure you draw a small dot where the eye of the elephant on the drawing.  
Marking eye is the game but the trick here is you will be blindfolded, spin few turns and left few yards away from the board. You need to find your way to the chair and mark the eye on the dot. Also other rules are you can't look for the board by trying to touch it. You need your other hand behind you. Your teammates can help you with forwarding you to the right direction by means of two words, hot or cold. Hot means you are going towards the chair and cold means you are going away from the chair. You only have 3 minutes to find your directions and mark the eye on the dot. 
Most players may not reach to the board. Also, you need to make sure you are listening to your teammates. If you are playing in teams, the other team players can mess with the directions.  It will be lots of fun, loud noise and laughs. Mostly the game ends with multiple eyes all over the board. The closest guess on the board to the dot will win.
